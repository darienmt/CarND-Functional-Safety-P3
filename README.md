# CarND-Functional-Safety-P3
Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree - Functional Safety Project

# Project overview

This project consist on creating the documentation for the functional safety of a Lane Assistance system under the umbrella of the [Road vehicles - Functional safety : ISO 26262](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262). ISO 26262 is an international standard for functional safety on electrical and/or electronic system in production automobiles defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The Lane Assistance system is part of a [Advanced Driver Assistance System(ADAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_driver-assistance_systems) with the following functionalities:

- Lane departure warning: When the driver drift toward the edge of the lane, the steering wheel vibrates to alert the driver.
- Lane keeping assistance: When the driver drift toward the edge of the lane, the steering wheel is turned toward the center of the lane to keep the car on its current lane.

 Udacity provides a seed project with document templates, architectural diagrams and guidance on how to approach the project. Here is the link to that [seed project](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Functional-Safety-Project)

The documentation consists on the following documents

- [Safety Plan](./01_SafetyPlan_LaneAssistance.pdf)
- [Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment](./02_HazardAnalysisAndRiskAssessment.pdf)
- [Functional Safety Concept](./03_FunctionalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance.pdf)
- [Technical Safety Concept](./04_TechnicalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance.pdf)
- [Software Requirements](./05_SoftwareRequirementsAndArchitecture_LaneAssistance.pdf)

The documents are in pdf format to facilitate the reading of it, but there versions of them in docx and xlsx format in the case of the hazard analysis and risk assessment.
